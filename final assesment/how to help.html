            <P> Fortunately we stil have time to reverse the effects of climate change and save the earth and mankind from the disasters caused by it. There are many ways to 
                fight climate change and reverse its effects, the 3 best methods are:
            </P>
            <ul>
                <li>Use clean energy sources</li>
                <li>Recycle</li>
                <li>Restore nature</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Use clean energy sources</h2>
            <p>The best way to combat climate change is to start with the root causes, in our case its greenhouse emissions. By using renewable energy sources instead of fossil fuels, such as wind power, solar
                energy and hydropower, by making small changes in how we change our energy production we can make huge steps towards our goal. Solar energy is a great way to combar the issue
                because it is very versatile it can be implemented in both large and small scales, from powering individual houses to powering entire <b>COUNTRIES</b> if taken advantage of.
            </p>
            <h2>Recycle</h2>
            <p> A great to dispose waste is to recycle, this way it can be given a new purpose and it will reduce the gas emmissions produced from burning the waste, although recycling
                has been around for a long period of time not everyone abides by it as its much more convenient to just throw everything away, but as more and more countries enforce recycling 
                rules and policies regarding waste managment the better it has gotten, by enforcing the rules and teaching people about the effects of pollution especially the younger generation
                the more cautious they will be about recycling and the greater the results.
            </p>
            <h2>Restore nature</h2>
            <p>By starting reforestaion plans we can restore the ecosystems destroyed by wildfires and we can give the animals that lost their habitats back and we can prevent the loss of
                species, planting trees also helps with reducing greenhouse emissions. Since trees use CO2 for energy production planting more of them would help reduce the concentration of it 
                in the atmosphere, this is our best long term method becuase the more the trees grow the more they absorb and if implemented with other short term methods mentioned we can help 
                reverse the effects of climate change </p>
