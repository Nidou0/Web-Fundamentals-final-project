            <h2> What is climate change</h2>
            <p>Climate change is one of the most devastating disasters that has come upon humanity, ironically it was caused by humans themselves through means described as achievments and advancements;
            Climate change refers to the long term increase in the earth's temperature which is also known as global warming.</p>

            <h2>What causes Climate Change?</h2>
            <p> Although climate change used to be a natural occurence the industrial evolution by man kind has been the main driver of this issue, through the industrial evolution era more and more 
                fossil fuels are being burnt by factories and cars. When fossil fuels are burnt they produce a type of gases called green house gases. when these gases are released in the atmosphere 
                they get trapped on the earths surface and they absorb the heat from the sun and allow the sun rays to pass but they dont allow it to exit the atmosphere which causes the heat to get 
                trapped and increases the earths temperature.

            <h2> Effects of Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Now that we established what climate change is let's talk about why its devestating. cliamte change has many effects which include:</p>
            <ul>
                <a href="#issue-1"><li>Hotter tempearatures</li></a>
                <a href="#issue-2"><li>Severe storms</li></a>
                <a href="#issue-3"><li>Rising oceans</li></a>
                <a href="#issue-4"><li>Loss of species</li></a>
			</ul>
            <h2 id="issue-1">Hotter tempearatures</h2>
            <P>Due to heat trapped by the greenhouse gases the earth now is 1.1 degrees hotter than it was in the 1800's and by the end of the century it is expected to increase to 
                4.4 degrees if no actions are taken to decrease the emission. This increase can many problems such as, incrased health issues such as lung tissue damage by increasing the concentration 
                of ozone in the air which poses a larger threat on people with existing lung problems, also the increased radiation can cause skin problems like skin cancer which is very 
                dangerous. The increase in tempearatures also poses a threat on food security, Evaporation is accelerated by warmer temperatures, which decreases surface water and dries out soils and vegetation.
                which can lead to greater problems such as resource conflict.</P>

                </figure>
            <p>The figure above shows the recorded temperatures for the earth's surface from the year 1880 to 2020, we can conclude from the graph that the temperature have drastically changed
                going form no more than 0 degrees celsius to above 1 degrees celsius.</p>
            <h2 id="issue-2">Severe storms</h2>
            <p>Due to the increased heat alot more water gets evaporated from the oceans, beacuse of that alot more water vapor gets trapped in the atmosphere, that causes extrewme rainfall and flooding.
                Warmer earth surface tempearatures have been found to increase wind speeds and the intensity of hurricanes, over the period of 1979-2017 it was shown that there are less small hurricanes but rather 
                but there are more intense hurricanes for example 4 and 5 category hurricanes, and due to the increase in water vapor hurricanes are getting wetter which makes the effects from hurricanes even more 
                devestating by causing more floods. </p>

                    <figcaption class="fig">Intense huricane rate increase</figcaption>
                </figure>
            <p> The figure above shows the proportion of major hurricane estimates from 1979-2017 the graph concludes an increase of major hurricanes by 25%. </p>
            <h2 id="issue-3">Rising oceans</h2>
            <p>The rise in oceans is getting caused by two main factors which are the melting of glaciers and ice sheets and the increase in sea water volume due to heat. The rise in ocean levels
                threatens the infrastructure needed for many local jobs such as Roads, bridges, subways, water supplies, oil and gas wells, power plants, sewage treatment plants and the list goes on.
                The increase in ocean levels also causes a rise in tide flooding frequency and they also cause more deadly storms such as hurricane katrina to push further inland which makes them 
                even more deadly and disruptive. Rise in water levels also cause damage to the antural ecossytem which will be talked about in the next section. 
            </p>

                <img src="SeaLevel.png" class="center">
                <figcaption class="fig"> Rising sea level</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> The figure above shows an increase of 102.5 milimeters in sea levels since 1993 to present day which is caused by the man made effect sof global warming.</p>
            <h2 id="issue-4"> Loss of species</h2>
            <p>In the natural world, the rise in sea levels is causing damage to natural costal ecosystems, it can cause saltwater intrusion where salt water is mixed with freshwater bodies
                and in result it poluutes the habitat for some fish species which cant survive with saltwater, it destroys the habitat needed for some animals to repoduce by covering the surfaces 
                of beaches which are used by some animals for nesting. The increase in earth temperatures is also melting away the habitat for polar bears, as more ice sheets and pieces melt 
                the harder it gets for polar bears to live on as they are forced to swim for longer distances to find bigger ice pieces that they can walk on and becuase of that they end up dying of 
                exhaustion and they drown. Now polar bears are forced to migrate to land which makes it harder to find prey and survive, it is now projected  for polar bear populations to 
                decline by 30% by the year 2050. </p>
